      <span class="c2"
        >Verse 1 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a
        dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and
        told the sum of the matters.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >This is the same Belshazzar mentioned in Daniel 5. Chronologically,
        this chapter precedes the fifth chapter; but chronology is here
        disregarded in order that the historical part of the book may stand by
        itself.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c2"
        >Verse 2 Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and,
        behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. 3 And
        four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >Daniel Relates His Own Vision. All Scripture language is to be taken
        literally, unless there exists some good reason for regarding it as
        figurative. All that is figurative is to be interpreted by that which is
        literal. That the language here used is symbolic is evident from verse
        17, which reads, &quot; These great beasts, which are four, are four
        kings which arise out of the earth.&quot; That kingdoms are intended,
        and not merely individual kings, is clear from the words, &quot;But the
        saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom.&quot; In explaining
        verse 23, the angel said, &quot;The fourth beast shall be the fourth
        kingdom upon the earth.&quot; these beasts are therefore symbols of four
        great kingdoms. The circumstances under which they arose, as represented
        in the prophecy, are also stated in symbolic language. The symbols
        introduced are the four winds, the sea, four great beasts, ten horns,
        and another horn which had eyes and a mouth and which rose up in war
        against God and His people. We have now to inquire what they
        denote.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >In symbolic language winds represent strife, political commotion, and
        war, as we read from the prophet Jeremiah:</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c0"
        >&quot;Thus said the Lord of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from
        nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the
        coasts of the earth. And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from
        one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth.&quot;
        Jeremiah 25: 32, 33. The prophet speaks of a controversy which the Lord
        is to have with all nations. The strife and commotion which produces all
        this destruction is called &quot;a great whirlwind.&quot;</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >That winds denote strife and war is evident in the vision itself. As
        the result of the blowing of the winds, kingdoms arise and fall through
        political strife.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >Seas, or waters, when used as Bible symbol, represent peoples, and
        nations, and tongues. Said the angel to the prophet John, &quot;The
        waters which thou saw . . . are peoples, and multitudes, and nations,
        and tongues.&quot; Revelation 17: 15.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >The definition of the symbol of the four beasts is given to Daniel
        before the close of the vision: &quot;These great beasts, which are
        four, are four kings which shall arise out of the earth.&quot; Verse 17.
        With this explanation of the symbols, the field of the vision is
        definitely opened before us.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >Since these beasts denote four kings, or kingdoms, we inquire, Where
        shall we begin and what four empires are represented? These beasts arise
        consecutively, for they are enumerated from the first to the fourth. The
        last one is in existence when all earthly scenes are brought to an end
        by the final judgment. From the time of Daniel to the end of this
        world&#39;s history, there were to be but four universal kingdoms, as we
        learned from Nebuchadnezzar&#39;s dream of the great image in Daniel 2,
        interpreted by the prophet sixty- five years before. Daniel was still
        living under the kingdom denoted by the head of gold.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >The first beast of this vision must therefore denote the same kingdom
        as the head of gold of the great image, namely, Babylon. The other
        beasts no doubt represent the succeeding kingdoms portrayed by that
        image. But if this vision covers essentially the same period of history
        as the image of Daniel 2, the query may arise, Why is it given? Why was
        not that first vision sufficient? We answer, The history of world
        empires is passed over again and again in order that additional
        characteristics may be brought out, and additional facts and features
        may be presented. It is thus that we have &quot;line upon line&quot;
        according to the Scriptures. In chapter 2, only the political aspects of
        world dominion are portrayed. Here earthly governments are introduced in
        their relationship to God&#39;s truth and God&#39;s people. Their true
        character is shown by symbols of wild and ravenous beasts.</span

        prophet was a lion. For the use of the lion as a symbol, read Jeremiah
        4: 7; 50: 17, 43, 44. The lion as first seen in the vision before us had
        eagle&#39;s wings. The symbolic use of wings is impressively described
        in Habakkuk 1: 6-8, where it is said that the Chaldeans should &quot;fly
        as the eagle that hastes to eat.&quot;</span

        great strength, and that under Nebuchadnezzar its conquests were
        extended with great rapidity. But there came a time when the wings were
        plucked. It no longer rushed upon tis prey like an eagle. The boldness
        and spirit of the lion were gone. A man&#39;s heart weak, timorous, and
        faint took the place of a lion&#39;s strength. Such was the case with
        the nation during the closing years of its history, when it had become
        enfeebled and effeminate through wealth and luxury.</span

        flesh.</span

    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >The Bear. As in the image of Daniel 2, so in this series of symbols a
        marked deterioration is noticed as we descend from one kingdom to
        another. The silver of the breast and arms is inferior to the gold of
        the head. The bear is inferior to the lion. Medo-Persia fell short of
        Babylon in wealth, magnificence, and brilliance. The bear raised itself
        up on one side. The kingdom was composed of two nationalities, the Medes
        and the Persians. The same fact is represented by the two horns of the
        ram in Daniel 8. Of these horns it is said that the higher horn came up
        last, and of the bear that it raised itself up on one side. This was
        fulfilled by the Persian division of the kingdom, for although it came
        up last, it attained the higher eminence, becoming a dominant influence
        in the nation. (See comments on Daniel 8: 3.) The three ribs doubtless
        signify the three provinces of Babylon, Lydia, and Egypt, which were
        especially oppressed by Medo-Persia. The command, &quot;Arise, devour
        much flesh,&quot; would naturally refer to the stimulus given to the
        Medes and Persians by the overthrow of these provinces. The character of
        the power is well represented by a bear. The Medes and Persians were
        cruel and rapacious, robbers and spoilers of the people. This
        Medo-Persian kingdom continued from the overthrow of Babylon by Cyrus to
        the battle of Arbela in 331 BC, a period of 207 years.</span

        >The Leopard. The third kingdom, Greece, is here represented by the
        symbol of a leopard. If wings upon the lion signified rapidity of
        conquest, they would signify the same here. The leopard itself is a
        swift-footed beast, but this was not sufficient to represent the career
        of the nation here symbolized. It must have wings in addition. Two
        wings, the number the lion had, were not sufficient; the leopard must
        have four. This would denote unprecedented celerity of movement, which
        we find to be a historical fact in the Grecian kingdom. The conquests of
        Greece under Alexander had no parallel in ancient times for suddenness
        and rapidity. His military achievements are summarized by W. W.

        united.&#39; He marched usually in two division, one conducting the
        impediments and his own [division] traveling light; his speed of
        movement was extraordinary. It is said that he attributed his military
        success to &#39;never putting anything off.&#39; . . . The enormous

        >&quot;The beast had also four heads&quot; The Grecian Empire maintained
        its unity but little longer than the lifetime of Alexander. After his
        brilliant career ended in a fever induced by a drunken debauch, the
        empire was divided among his four leading generals. Cassander had
        Macedonia and Greece in the west; Lysimachus had Thrace and the parts of
        Asia on the Hellespont and the Bosphorus in the north; Ptolemy received
        Egypt, Lydia, Arabia, Palestine, and Coele-Syria in the south; and
        Seleucus had Syria and all the rest of Alexander&#39;s dominions in the
        east. By the year 301 BC, with the death of Antigonus, the division of
        the kingdom of Alexander into four parts was completed by his general.
        [2] These division were denoted</span

        left no available successor, why did not the huge empire break up into
        countless petty fragments? Why into just four parts, and no more? For
        reasons that the prophecy foresaw and foretold. The leopard had four
        heads, the rough goat four horns, the kingdom was to have four
        divisions; and thus it was. (See more fully in comments on Daniel 8.) </span

        fourth division of the great image the legs of iron. In the comment on
        Daniel 2: 40 are given some reasons for believing this power to be Rome.
        The same reasons are applicable to the present prophecy. How accurately
        Rome answered to the iron portion of the image! How accurately it
        answers to the beast before us! In the dread and terror which it
        inspired, and in its great strength, it answered admirably to the
        prophetic description. The world had never seen its equal. It devoured
        as with iron teeth, and broke in pieces all that stood in its way. It
        ground the nations into the dust beneath its brazen feet. It had ten
        horns, which are explained in verse 24 to be ten kings, or kingdoms,
        which should arise out of this empire. As already noticed in comments on
        Daniel 2, Rome was divided into ten kingdoms. These divisions have ever
        since been spoken of as the ten kingdoms of the Roman Empire.</span

        equally correct translation is &quot;to set or place in order,&quot; as
        in the placing of the judgement seats mentioned here, as also a like
        setting or placing in Revelation 4: 2, in which the Greek bears out the

        assertion; but granting that it were true, is not one description of
        this kind as fatal to their as though it were repeated a score of times?
        The thousand thousands who minister unto Him, and the ten thousand times
        ten thousand who stand before Him, are not sinners arraigned before the
        judgement seat, but heavenly intelligences who wait before Him,
        attendant on His will. John saw the same heavenly attendants before the
        throne of God, and he describes the majestic scene in these words:
        &quot;I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the
        throne, and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten

        beast, because of its unnatural and dreadful character. It was of this
        beast and its ten horns, more particularly of the little horn which came
        up last, &quot;whose look was more stout than his fellows,&quot; that he
        desired further information. The lion is a production of nature, but it
        must have the addition of two wings to represent the kingdom of Babylon.
        The bear we also find in nature, but as a symbol of Medo-Persia an
        unnatural ferocity must be denoted by the three ribs in its mouth. So
        the leopard is a beast of nature, yet fitly to represent Greece, four
        wings and three more heads must be added. But nature furnishes no symbol
        which can fitly illustrate the fourth kingdom. The vision therefore
        introduces a beast the likeness of which was never before seen, a beast
        dreadful and terrible, with nails of brass, and teeth of iron, so cruel,
        rapacious, and fierce that from mere love of oppression it devoured, and
        broke in pieces, and trampled its victims beneath its feet.</span

    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >Astounding as all this was to the prophet, there was something still
        more remarkable that gripped his attention. A little horn came up, and

        had a mouth, and with that mouth it uttered proud sayings, and put forth
        preposterous and arrogant claims. No wonder the prophet made special
        inquiry respecting this monster, so unearthly in its instincts, so
        fiendish in its works and ways. In the following verses some

        fatal to the supremacy of a Catholic bishop. The prophecy, however, had

        of Rome. Thomas Newton [7] states serious objections to both these

        they were never plucked up. The Lombards could not have been one, for
        they were never made subject to the popes. Says Albert Barnes further,
        &quot;I do not find, indeed, that the kingdom of the Lombards was, as is
        commonly stated among the number of the temporal sovereignties that
        became subject to the authority of the popes.&quot; [8] The senate and
        dukedom of Rome could not have been one, for as they never constituted

        and could not have been until the pope became a temporal prince.
        Therefore they sought to find an accomplishment of the prophecy in the
        events which led to the pope&#39;s temporal sovereignty. But evidently
        the prophecy of verses 24, 25, refers, not to his civil power, but to
        his power to domineer over the minds and consciences of men. The papacy
        reached this position, AD 583, as will hereafter appear.</span

        &quot;from before Him.&quot; We have, then, in verse 8 the picture of
        the little horn pressing in among the ten and forcibly plucking up three
        horns from before it. In verse 20, it is declared that the three horns
        &quot;fell&quot; from before it, as if overcome by it. In verse 24, we
        read that another king, representing the little horn, &quot;shall subdue

        qadam is also used in the sense of time, as in the word
        &quot;before&quot; in verse 7, there can scarcely be a doubt that it is

        reigned over the Romans. He took the throne of Italy, AD 476. Of his
        religious belief Gibbon says: &quot;Like the rest of the barbarians he

        understanding it of the Roman Catholic Church, made answer: &quot;This
        argument proves not the sentiment, but the ignorance or impudence of
        Luther; for as almost an infinite number were either burned or otherwise

        Italy, from 1545 to 1563. Since that council, called to counteract the
        spreading influence of the Protestant Reformation, dealt so widely with
        the doctrines and usages of the church, it officially decreed the
        following: &quot;The holy synod commands all bishops. . . [to explain
        the sacraments] according to the form to be prescribed by the holy synod
        for all the sacraments in a catechism, which bishops will take care to
        have faithfully translated into the vulgar tongue, and expounded to the
        people by the parish priests.&quot; [35]</span

        regard to the fourth (Catholic third) commandment:</span

    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >&quot;It pleased the church of God, that the religious celebration of
        the Sabbath day should be transferred to the Lord&#39;s day [meaning
        Sunday]; for as on that day light first shone on the world; so by the
        resurrection of our Redeemer on that day, who opened to us the gate to
        life eternal, our life was recalled out of darkness into light; whence
        also the Apostles would have it named &#39;the Lord&#39;s day.&#39; We
        also observe in the Sacred Scriptures that this day was held sacred
        because on that day the creations of the world commenced, and the Holy
        Ghost was given to the apostles.&quot; [36]</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >Here is the declaration of the papacy that the Roman Catholic Church
        changed the time for observing the Sabbath from the seventh day
        according to the decalogue to the first day of the week, which it here
        erroneously calls &quot;the Lord&#39;s day.&quot; (See comment on
        Revelation 1: 10.) It will be observed that the apostles are here
        charged with making the change from seventh day to the first, but
        without any proof whatsoever from the Scriptures, because there is no
        such proof. All the reasons for the change given in this declaration,
        are purely of human and ecclesiastical invention.</span

    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >The foregoing testimony is sufficient to show how the papacy has
        thought to change times and laws. How later Roman Catholic catechisms
        for instruction of &quot;the faithful&quot; come out boldly in declaring
        that the church changed the day, and even taunt Protestants with
        acceptance and observance of the change, will be found in our comment on
        the mark of the beast in Revelation 13, pages 608-612.</span

    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >Before leaving this matter of the change of the Sabbath, it will be
        enlightening to observe other reasons given by the papacy for the change
        than the false one that it was made by the apostles. In the same Roman
        Catechism referred to above, is an attempt to explain how the Sabbath
        commandment differs from the others in the decalogue:</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >&quot;That difference, then, appears certain, that the other precepts
        of the decalogue belong to the natural law, and are perpetual and
        unalterable, whence is it that, although the law of Moses has been
        abrogated, yet the Christian people observe all the commandments which
        are contained in the two tables, not because Moses so commanded, but
        because they agree with the law of nature, by the force of which men are
        impelled to their observance; whereas this commandment, touching the
        sanctification of the Sabbath, if considered as to the time appointed
        [for its observance], is not fixed and unalterable, but susceptible of
        change, nor does it belong to the moral but ceremonial law, neither is
        it a principle of the natural law, for we are [not] taught or formed by
        nature to give external worship to God on that rather than on any other
        day; but from the time the people of Israel were liberated from the
        bondage of Pharaoh, they observed the Sabbath day. . . .</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >&quot;But the time when the observance of the Sabbath was to be
        removed, is that same time when the other Hebrew rites and ceremonies
        were to be abrogated, namely, at the death of Christ; for as those
        ceremonies are, as it were, images that shadowed forth the light and
        truth (Hebrews x, 1), it was, therefore, necessary that they should be
        removed at the coming of the light and truth, which is Jesus
        Christ.&quot; [37]</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c1">
      <span class="c0"
        >The reader needs only to be reminded that the ten-commandment law was
        written with God&#39;s finger on tables of stone, while the ceremonial
        laws were written by Moses in a book. More than this, the decalogue was
        written by Moses in a book. More than this, the decalogue was written
        before the ceremonial laws were given to Moses. Shall we charge God with
        mixing in one ceremonial command with the nine of the moral law, and
        leave it to a presumptuous ecclesiastical body to make the correction?
        The reason also for the observance of the seventh-day Sabbath, as given
        in the commandment itself, is that the Creator Himself rested on that
        day, and set it apart as a memorial of His work of creation, but with
        no</span

    <p class="c4">

        day;&#39; for St. John, in his Apocalypse, makes mention of &#39;the
        Lord&#39;s day&#39; (Apocalypse i,10); and the Apostle orders
        collections to made on the first day of the week&#39; (1 Corinthians
        xvi,2), which is, as St. Chrysostom interprets, the Lord&#39;s day; to
        give us to understand, that even the Lord&#39;s day was kept holy in the

        support the change of the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of

        term &quot;Lord&#39;s day&quot; in Revelation 1: 10, despite the fact
        that the only day God ever set apart as holy and claimed as His own by
        resting on it Himself was the seventh day of the fourth
        commandment.</span

        and worship, but assert that the time of its observance is
        &quot;susceptible of change,&quot; since, according to their argument,
        it does not &quot;belong to the moral but ceremonial law,&quot; and was
        therefore changed by the apostles, by the Fathers, and by the church to
        the first day of the week.</span

        place on that day, the Holy Spirit descended on the apostles on the same
        day of the week, Paul admonished Christians to reckon their business
        accounts and lay aside a portion for the Lord on the first day of the
        week all of human invention and without Scriptural authority as reasons
        for such a change. The only reasons given by the Creator and Lord of the
        Sabbath, are that He created the world in six days, rested on the
        seventh, and set apart that day for holy use on the same permanent and
        unalterable basis as He created all other things on the other days of

        >&quot;A Time and Times and the Dividing of Time.&quot; The pronoun
        &quot;they&quot; in the sentence containing this phrase embraces the
        saints, the times, and the laws just mentioned. How long a time were
        they to be given into the hands of this power. A time, as we have seen
        from Daniel 4: 23, is one year; two times, the least that could be
        denoted by the plural, two years, and the dividing of time, or half a
        time, half a year. The word &quot;dividing&quot; in the phrase
        &quot;dividing of time&quot; is translated from the Chaldee word {HEBREW
        CHARACTERS IN PRINTED TEXT}, pelage, which Gesenius defines as &quot;a
        half,&quot; and refers to Daniel 7: 25 as an example. The Septuagint
        translates it &quot;half.&quot; We thus have three years and a half for
        the continuance of this power. The Chaldee word for &quot;time&quot; in
        the text before us, is {HEBREW CHARACTERS IN PRINTED TEXT}, iddan, which
        Gesenius defines thus: &quot;Time. Spec. in prophetic language for a
        year. Daniel 7: 25, {HEBREW CHARACTERS IN PRINTED TEXT} for a year, also
        two years and half a year; i.e., for three years and a half; comp. Jos.

        a half of prophetic time? The principle given us in the Bible is, that
        when a day is used in symbolic prophecy, it stands for a year. (Ezekiel

        {HEBREW CHARACTERS IN PRINTED TEXT} [iddan] denotes both time and year;

        figures of the twelfth century, applied the year-day principle to the
        1260-year period. &quot;The woman, clothed with the sun, who signifies
        the church, remained hidden in the wilderness from the face of the
        serpent, a day without doubt being accepted for a year and a thousand

        >The Bible year, which must be used as the basis of reckoning, contained
        three hundred and sixty days. (See comments on Revelation 11: 3.) Three
        years and a half contained twelve hundred and sixty days. As each day
        stands for a year, we have twelve hundred and sixty years for the
        continuation of the supremacy of this horn. Did the papacy posses
        dominion that length of time? The answer again is, Yes. The edict of the
        emperor Justinian, dated AD 533, made the bishop of Rome the head of all
        the churches. But this edict could not go into effect until the Arian
        Ostrogoths, the last of the three horns that were plucked up to make
        room for the papacy, were driven from Rome; and this was not
        accomplished, as already shown, until AD 538. (See p. 127.) The edict
        would have been of no effect had this latter event not been
        accomplished; hence from this latter year we are to reckon, as this was
        the earliest point where the saints were in reality in the hands of this
        power. From this point did the papacy hold supremacy for twelve hundred
        and sixty years? Exactly. For 538 + 1260 = 1798; and in the year 1798,
        Berthier, with a French army, entered Rome, proclaimed a republic, took
        the pope prisoner, and inflicted a deadly wound upon the papacy. Though
        it has never since enjoyed all the privileges and immunities which it
        possessed before, we are seeing a gradual restoration of its former
        strength.</span

        little horn, and stating that the saints should be given into his hand
        for 1260 years, bringing us down to 1798, verse 26 declares: &quot;But
        the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to
        consume and to destroy it unto the end.&quot; In verse 10 of the same
        chapter we have substantially the same expression regarding the
        judgment: &quot;The judgment was set.&quot; It would seem consistent to
        suppose that the same judgment is referred to in both instances. But the
        sublime scene described in verse 10 is the opening of the investigative
        judgment in the sanctuary in heaven, as will appear in remarks on Daniel
        8: 14 and 9: 25-27. The opening of this judgment scene is located by the
        prophecy at the close of the great prophetic period of 2300 years, which
        terminated in 1844. (See comments on Daniel 9: 25-27.)</span

        many thrones in Europe, also drove the pope from his dominions. His
        restoration shortly after was through the forces of foreign bayonets, by
        which alone he was upheld until his final loss of temporal power in
        1870. The overthrow of the papacy in 1798 marked the conclusion of the
        prophetic period of 1260 years, and constituted the &quot;deadly
        wound,&quot; prophesied in Revelation 13: 3 to come upon this power; but

        dogma of the Immaculate conception was decreed by the pope. In 1870 the
        armies of Victor Emmanuel took away the temporal power of the pope, the
        very year that the Twentieth Ecumenical Council decreed the
        infallibility of the pope when speaking ex cathedra, that is, when as
        shepherd and teacher of all Christians he defines a doctrine concerning
        faith or morals. But despite the increasing honors heaped upon the
        office of the bishop of Rome by the clergy, the pope&#39;s temporal
        power was wholly taken away. Thereafter the popes shut themselves up as
        prisoners in the Vatican at Rome until the signing of the concordat with
