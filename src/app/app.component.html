          >Verse 1 And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar
          Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and
          his sleep brake from him.</span

        <span class="c1"
          >With unerring accuracy, the pen of prophecy has traced the course of
          history down to our day. Daniel was carried into captivity in the
          first year of Nebuchadnezzar. For three years he was placed under
          instructors, during which time he would not of course be reckoned
          among the wise men of the kingdom, nor take part in public affairs.
          Yet in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar, the transactions recorded in
          this chapter took place. How, then, could Daniel be brought in to
          interpret the king&#39;s dream in his second year? The explanation
          lies in the fact that Nebuchadnezzar reigned for two years conjointly
          with his father, Nabopolassar. From this point the Jews reckoned,
          while the Chaldeans reckoned from the time he began to reign alone on
          the death of his father. Hence, the year here mentioned was the second
          year of his reign according to the Chaldean reckoning, but the fourth
          according to the Jewish. [1] It thus appears that the next year after
          Daniel had completed his preparation to participate in the affairs of
          the Chaldean empire, the providence of God brought him into sudden and
          remarkable prominence throughout the kingdom.</span

          >The King&#39;s Wise Men Fail Him. The magicians practiced magic,
          using the term in its bad sense; that is, they employed all the
          superstitious rites and ceremonies of fortunetellers, and casters of
          nativities, and the like. Astrologers were men who pretended to
          foretell events by the study of the stars. The science, or the
          superstition, of astrology was extensively cultivated by the Eastern
          nations of antiquity. Sorcerers were such as pretended to hold
          communication with the dead. In this sense, we believe, the word
          &quot;sorcerer&quot; is always used in the Scriptures. The Chaldeans
          here mentioned were a sect of philosophers similar to the magicians
          and astrologers, who made natural science and divinations their study.
          All these sects or professions abounded in Babylon. The result desired
          by each was the same the explaining of mysteries and foretelling of
          events the principal difference between them being the means by which
          they sought to accomplish their object. The king&#39;s difficulty lay
          equally within the province of each to explain; hence he summoned them
          all. With the king it was an important matter. He was greatly
          troubled, and therefore concentrated upon the solution of his
          perplexity the wisdom of his realm.</span

          >In whatever else the ancient magicians and astrologers may have been
          efficient, they seem to have been thoroughly schooled in the art of
          drawing out sufficient information to form a basis for some shrewd
          calculation, or of framing their answers in such an ambiguous manner
          that they would be applicable whichever way the events turned. In the
          present case, true to their cunning instincts, they called upon the
          king to make known to them his dream. If they could get full
          information respecting this, they could easily agree on some
          interpretation which would not endanger their reputation. They
          addressed themselves to the king in Syriac, a dialect of the Chaldean
          language which was used by the educated and cultured classes. From
          this point to the end of Daniel 7, the record continues in Chaldaic,
          the language spoken by the king.</span

          interpretation thereof, you shall be cut in pieces, and your houses
          shall be made a dunghill. 6 But if you show the dream, and the
          interpretation thereof, you shall receive of me gifts and rewards and
          great honor: therefore show me the dream, and the interpretation
          thereof. 7 They answered again and said, Let the king tell his
          servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation of it. 8 The
          king answered and said, I know of certainty that you would gain the
          time, because you see the thing is gone from me. 9 But if</span

      <p class="c10">
        <span class="c4"
          >you will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree
          for you: for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before
          me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall
          know that you can show me the interpretation thereof. 10 The Chaldeans
          answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth
          that can show the king&#39;s matter: therefore there is no king, lord,
          nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or
          Chaldean. 11 And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there
          is none other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose
          dwelling is not with flesh. 12 For this cause the king was angry and
          very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. 13
          And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they
          sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</span

          >These verses contain the record of the desperate struggle between the
          wise men and the king. The former sought some avenue of escape, since
          they were caught on their own ground. The king was determined that
          they should make known his dream, which was no more than should be
          expected from their profession.</span

        <span class="c1"
          >Some have severely censured Nebuchadnezzar in this matter, as acting
          the part of a heartless, unreasonable tyrant. But what did these
          magicians profess to be able to do? To reveal hidden things, to
          foretell events, to make known mysteries entirely beyond human
          foresight and penetration, and to do this by the aid of supernatural
          agencies. There was therefore nothing unjust in Nebuchadnezzar&#39;s
          demand that they should make known his dream. When they declared that
          none but the gods whose dwelling was not with flesh could make known
          the king&#39;s matter, it was a tacit acknowledgment that they had no
          communication with these gods, and knew nothing beyond what human
          wisdom and discernment could reveal. &quot;For this cause the king was
          angry and very furious.&quot;</span

          deception. While we cannot justify the extreme measures to which he
          resorted, dooming them to death, and their houses to destruction, we
          cannot but feel a hearty sympathy with him in his condemnation of a
          class of miserable imposters. The king would be no party to dishonesty

          captain of the king&#39;s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise
          men of Babylon: 15 he answered and said to Arioch the king&#39;s
          captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made
          the thing known to Daniel. 16 Then Daniel went in, and desired of the
          king that he would give him time, and that he would show the king the
          interpretation. 17 Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing
          known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: 18 that they
          would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that

          >Daniel to the Rescue. In this narrative we see the providence of God
          working in several remarkable particulars. It was providential that
          the dream of the king should leave such a powerful impression upon his
          mind as to raise him to the greatest height of anxiety, and yet the
          thing itself be held from his recollection. This led to the complete
          exposure of the false system of the magicians and other pagan
          teachers. When put to the test to make known the dream, they were
          unable to do what they professed was entirely within their
          power.</span

          >It was remarkable that Daniel and his companions, so lately
          pronounced by the king ten times better than all his magicians and
          astrologers, should not have been consulted in this matter. But there
          was a providence in this. Just as the dream was held from the king, so
          he was unaccountably restrained from appealing to Daniel for a
          solution of the mystery. Had he called Daniel at the first to make
          known the matter, the magicians would not have been brought to the
          test. But God would give the heathen systems of the Chaldeans the
          first chance. He would let them try and ignominiously fail, and then
          confess their utter incompetency, ever under the penalty of death,
          that they might be the better prepared to acknowledge His intervention
          when He should finally manifest His power in behalf of His captive
          servants, and for the honor of His name.</span

          presence of the executioners, come for his arrest. His own life being
          thus at stake, he was led to seek the Lord with all his heart until He
          should work for the deliverance of His servants. Daniel gained his
          request of the king for time to consider the matter a privilege which
          probably none of the magicians could have obtained, as the king had
          already accused them of preparing false and corrupt words, and of
          seeking to gain time for this very purpose. Daniel at once went to his
          three companions, and asked them to unite with him in desiring mercy

          for the things He has done for us, as well as by our petitions to Him

          no mercy from the hand of God fail of its due return of thanksgiving
          and praise. In the days of Christ&#39;s ministry on earth, did He not
          cleanse ten lepers, and only one returned to give Him thanks?

          through no merit of theirs or their heathen systems of divination that
          this revelation was made. They were worthy of as much condemnation as
          before. But their own confession of utter impotence in the matter was
          humiliation enough for them, and Daniel was anxious that they should
          so far partake of the benefits shown him as to have their lives
          spared. They were saved because there was a man of God among them.
          Thus it ever is. For the sake of Paul and Silas, all the prisoners
          with them were loosed. (Acts 16: 26.) For the sake of Paul, the lives
          of all that sailed with him were saved. (Acts 27: 24.) How often the
          wicked are benefited by the presence of the righteous! Well would be

          No longer than the antediluvians were suffered after Noah had entered
          the ark, or the Sodomites after Lot had departed from their polluted
          and polluting presence. If only ten righteous persons could have been

          make known this secret. It was beyond their power. Therefore the king
          should not be angry with them, nor put confidence in their vain

          king thought forward upon the days to come, with an anxious desire to
          know with what events they should be filled. It was partly for this
          reason that God gave him this dream, which we must regard as a token
          of divine favor to the king. Yet God would not work for the king
          independently of His own people. Though He gave the dream to the king,
          He sent the interpretation through one of His acknowledged

          dream had been given to him, it was not for his sake alone that the
          interpretation was sent, but also for their sakes through whom it
          should be given. Ah! God had some servants there, and it was for them

          emptiness and worthlessness of earthly pomp and glory. how could this
          be more impressively done than by an image whose head was of gold?
          Below this head was body composed of inferior metals descending in
          value until they reached their basest form in the feet and toes of
          iron mingled with miry clay. The whole was then dashed to pieces, and
          made like the empty chaff. It was finally blown away where no place
          could be found for it, after which something durable and of heavenly
          worth occupied its place. So would God show to the children of men
          that earthly kingdoms are to pass away, and earthly greatness and
          glory, like a gaudy bubble, will break and vanish. In the place so
          long usurped by these, the kingdom of God shall be set up and have no

          of the histories of world empire. Eight short verses of the inspired
          record tell the whole story, yet that story embraces the history of
          this world&#39;s pomp and power. A few moments will suffice to commit
          it to memory, yet the period which it covers, beginning more than
          twenty-five centuries ago, reaches from that far-distant point past
          the rise and fall of kingdoms, past the setting up and overthrow of
          empires, past cycles and ages, past our own day, to the eternal state.
          It is so comprehensive that it embraces all this, yet it is so minute
          that it gives us the great outlines of earthly kingdoms from that time
          to this. Human wisdom never devised so brief a record that embraced so
          much. Human language never set forth in so few words such a great
          volume of historical truth. The finger of God is here. Let us heed the
          lesson well. With what interest and astonishment must the king have
          listened as he was informed by the prophet that his kingdom was the
          golden head of the magnificent image. Daniel in formed the king that
          the God of heavens had given him his kingdom, and made him ruler over
          all. This would restrain him from the pride of thinking that he had
          attained his position by his own power and wisdom, and would enlist
          the gratitude of his heart toward the true God.</span

          more than two thousand years before Christ. &quot;Cush begat Nimrod:
          he began to be a mighty one in the earth. He was a mighty hunter
          before the Lord: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty
          hunter before the Lord. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel
          [&quot;Babylon,&quot; margin], and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in
          the land of Shinar.&quot; Genesis 10: 8-10. It appears that Nimrod

          &quot;Events had already shown that Nebuchadrezzar was a vigorous and
          brilliant commander, and physically as well as mentally a strong man,
          fully worthy of succeeding his father. He was to become the greatest
          man of his time in the Near East, as a soldier, a statesman, and an
          architect. Had his successors been of such a stamp instead of callow
          boys or dilettanti without redeeming vigor, the Persians would have
          found Babylonia a harder problem. &#39;All the nations,&#39; says

          >The Fall of Babylon. In the first year of Neriglissar, only two years
          after death of Nebuchadnezzar, broke out that fatal war between the
          Babylonians and the Medes, which resulted in the overthrow of the
          Babylonian kingdom. Cyaxares, king of the Medes, who is called
          &quot;Darius&quot; in Daniel 5: 31, summoned to his aid his nephew
          Cyrus of the Persian line. The war was prosecuted with uninterrupted
          success by the Medes and Persians, until in the eighteenth year of
          Nabonidus (the third year of his son Belshazzar), Cyrus laid siege to
          Babylon, the only city in all the East which then held out against
          him. The Babylonians gathered within their seemingly impregnable
          walls, with provision on hand for twenty years, and land within the
          limits of their broad city sufficient to furnish food for the
          inhabitants and garrison for an indefinite period. They scoffed at
          Cyrus from their lofty walls, and derided his seemingly useless
          efforts to bring them into subjection. According to all human
          calculation, they had good ground for their feelings of security.
          Never, weighed in the balance of earthly probability, could that city
          be taken with the means of warfare then known. Hence they breathed as
          freely and slept as soundly as though no foe were waiting and watching
          around their beleaguered walls. But God had decreed that the proud and
          wicked city should come down from her throne of glory. And when He
          speaks, what mortal arm can defeat His word?</span

          resolved to accomplish by stratagem what he could not effect by force.
          Learning of the approach of an annual festival in which the whole city
          would be given up to mirth and revelry, he fixed upon that day as the
          time to carry his purpose into execution.</span

          >There was no entrance for him into that city unless he could find it
          where the River Euphrates entered and emerged, as it passed under the
          walls. He resolved to make the channel of the river his highway into
          the stronghold of his enemy. To do this, the water must be turned
          aside from its channel through the city. For this purpose, on the
          evening of the feast day above referred to, he detailed on body of
          soldiers to turn the river at a given hour into a large artificial
          lake a short distance above the city; another to take their station at
          the point where the river entered the city; and a third to take a
          position fifteen miles below, where the river emerged from the city.
          The two latter bodies were instructed to enter the channel as soon as
          they found the river fordable, and in the darkness of the night
          explore their way beneath the walls, and press on to the palace of the
          king where they were to surprise and kill the guards, and capture or
          slay the king. When the water was turned into the lake, the river soon
          became shallow enough to ford, and the soldiers followed its channel
          into the heart of the city of Babylon. [5]</span

          Cyrus calculated largely for the carrying out of his purpose. On each
          side of the river through the entire length of the city were walls of
          great height, and of equal thickness with the outer walls. In these
          walls were huge gates of brass, which, when closed and guarded,
          debarred all entrance from the river bed to any of the streets that
          crossed the</span

          might have marched into the city along the river bed, and then marched

          before in these words: &quot;Thus said the Lord to His anointed, to
          Cyrus, whose right hand I have held, to subdue nations before him; and
          I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two-leaved
          gates; and the gates shall not be shut.&quot; Isaiah 45: 1. The
          entrance of the Persian soldiers was not perceived. Many a cheek would
          have paled with terror, had the sudden going down of the river been
          noticed, and its fearful import understood. Many a tongue would have
          spread wild alarm through the city, had the dark forms of armed foes
          been seen stealthily treading their way to the citadel of their
          supposed security. But no one noticed the sudden subsidence of the
          waters of the river; no one saw the entrance of the Persian warriors;
          no one cared for aught but to see how deeply and recklessly he could
          plunge into the wild debauch. That night&#39;s dissipation cost the
          Babylonians their kingdom and their freedom. They went into their

          and died fighting for his life. This feast of Belshazzar is described

          surpassing anything else in the world, would have taken it as the seat
          of his empire, and maintained it in its splendor. But God had said
          that that city should become a heap, and the habitation of the beasts
          of the desert; that its houses should be full of doleful creatures;
          that the wild beasts of the islands should cry in its desolate
          dwellings, and dragons in its pleasant palaces. (Isaiah 13: 19-22.) It
          must first be deserted. Cyrus established a second capital at Susa, a
          celebrated city in the province of Elam, east from Babylon, on the
          banks of the River Choaspes, a branch of the Tigris. This was probably

          and brought upon themselves again the whole strength of the Persian
          Empire. The city was once more taken by stratagem. Darius took away
          the brazen gates of the city, and beat down the walls from two hundred
          cubits to fifty cubits. This was the beginning of its destruction. By
          this act, it was left exposed to the ravages of every hostile band.
          Xerxes, on his return from Greece, plundered the temple of Belus of
          its immense wealth, and then laid the lofty structure in ruins.
          Alexander the Great endeavored to rebuild it, but after employing ten
          thousand men two months to clear away the rubbish, he died from
          excessive drunkenness and debauchery, and the work was suspended. In
          the year 294 BC, Seleucus Nicator built the city of New Babylon in the
          neighborhood of the old city, and took much of the material and many
          of the inhabitants of the old city, to build up and people the new.
          Now almost exhausted of inhabitants, neglect and decay were telling
          fearfully upon the ancient capital. The violence of Parthian princes
          hastened its ruin. About the end of the fourth century, it was used by
          the Persian kings as an enclosure for wild beasts. At the end of the
          twelfth century, according to a celebrated traveler, the few remaining
          ruins of Nebuchadnezzar&#39;s palace were so full of serpents and
          venomous reptiles that they could not be closely inspected without
          great danger. And today scarcely enough even of the ruins is left to

          prosecution of some minor conquest. He entered upon a pompous campaign
          into India, because, according to Grecian fable, Bacchus and Hercules,
          two sons of Jupiter, whose son he also claimed to be, had done the

          gold, the breast and arms of silver, and the sides of brass, is

          views, there is strangely a difference of opinion as to what kingdom
          is symbolized by the fourth division of the great image the legs of
          iron. What kingdom succeeded Greece in the empire of the world, for
          the legs of iron denote the fourth kingdom in the series? The
          testimony of history is full and explicit on this point. One kingdom
          did this, and one only, and that was Rome. It conquered Greece; it
          subdued all things; like iron, it broke in pieces and bruised.</span

          a superlative degree during the first centuries of its career. Luxury,

          fourth beast represents the same kingdom as do the iron legs of the

          of the image. These horns are plainly declared to be ten kings which
          should arise. They are as much independent kingdoms as are the beasts

          not denote a line of successive kings, but kings or kingdoms which
          existed contemporaneously, for three of them were plucked up by the

          &quot;in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a

          up, there will exist a plurality of kings. It cannot refer to the four
          preceding kingdoms; for it would be absurd to use such language in
          reference to a line of successive kings, since it would be in the days

          extent of the division which the prophecy shows did exist. To suppose
          this would be to cast a serious imputation upon the prophecy itself.

          this dissolution thus covered a hundred and twenty-five years, from
          about the middle of the fourth century to the last quarter of the
          fifth. No historians of whom we are aware, place the beginning of this
          work of the dismemberment of the Roman Empire earlier than AD 351, and
          there is general agreement in assigning its close in AD 476.
          Concerning the intermediate dates, that is, the precise time from
          which each of the ten kingdoms that arose on the ruins of the Roman
          Empire is to be dated, there is some difference of views among
          historians. Nor does this seem strange, when we consider that there
          was an ear of great confusion, that the map of the Roman Empire during
          that time underwent many sudden and violent changes, and that paths of
          hostile nations charging upon its territory crossed and recrossed each
          other in a labyrinth of confusion. But all historians agree in this,
          that out of the territory of Western Rome, ten separate kingdoms were
          ultimately established, and we may safely assign them to the time
          between the dates above named; namely AD 351 and 476.</span

          well as the toes? Would it not be as inconsistent to say that the toes
          denote division and the legs do not, as to say that the legs denote
          division and the toes do not? We answer that the prophecy itself must
          govern our conclusions in this matter; for though it says nothing of
          division in connection with the legs, it does introduce the subject of
          division as we come to the feet and toes. The record says,
          &quot;Whereas thou saw the feet and toes, part of potters&#39; clay
          and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided.&quot; No division
          could take place, or at least none is said to have taken place, until
          the weakening element of the clay is introduced; and we do not find
          this until we come to the feet and toes. But we are not to understand
          that the clay denotes one division and the iron the other; for after
          the long-existing unity of the kingdom was broken, no one of the
          fragments was broken, no one of the fragments was a strong as the
          original iron, but all were in a state of weakness denoted by the
          mixture of iron and clay.</span

          the clay element, as we come to the feet, resulted in the division of
          the kingdom into ten parts, as represented by the ten toes; and this
          result, or division, is more than intimated in the sudden mention of a
          plurality of contemporaneous kings. Therefore, while we find no
          evidence that the legs denote division, but serious objections against
          such a view, we do find good reason for supposing that the toes denote
          division, as here claimed.</span

          the Western Empire. Rome conquered the world, but the kingdom of Rome
          proper lay west of Greece. That is what was represented by the legs of
          iron. There, then, we look for the ten kingdoms, and there we find

          science of war, to consolidate them into one vast empire. But when
          Rome fell, such possibilities forever passed away. The iron was mixed
          with clay, and lost the power of cohesion. No man or combination of

          continue, in this tenfold division, until the kingdom of the stone

          mighty, consolidated empire. And did he succeed? Nay. The very power
          with which he was allied, proved his destruction, in the troops of

          so in the one case; the word of prophecy in the other. Yet there was
          to be the attempt to mingle nay, more, there was an approach at
          mingling in both cases. But it was to be abortive. And how marked the

          to the little flock. (Luke 12: 32.) Through much tribulation the
          saints are to enter the coming kingdom. (Acts 14: 22.) It is to be set
